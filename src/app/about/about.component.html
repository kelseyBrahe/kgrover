                    I'm 23 years old, residing in the stunning town of Kimberley, BC. 
                    I share my home with my partner Hugo, our lovable pup Pippin, 
                    and our two charming cats, Milo and Felix.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love to garden, read, sing and hike. I love where I live, and 
                    I am excited for the new adventures ahead of me.

                    I have been working on my Bachelor of Computer Science since
                    2019. I have completed my study online with the University of
                    New England, Australia (my home country).

                    While studying I worked as a waitress at a lovely little
                    restaurant, Pedal & Tap, where I learned a lot about
                    catering to people and helping them get the experience
                    they are after. In the gaps of all that, we made
                    sure to get out and about to enjoy this beautiful place we
                    live in.

                    My passions are with front-end design. I want to create websites
                    and user interfaces that truly represent the essence of each
                    business and individual I work with. I also want them to be a 
                    pleasure to use on the client-side. Each website should be 
                    a great experience - it's often the first your customer will
                    have with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To help me achieve this I have been working on my Google UX 
                    Design Certificate during breaks at university.

                    I am hoping it gives you a sense of who I am and what I can

                    why I am seeking a remote or local position, and gives you
                    confidence that I have experience working from home and juggling
                    responsibilities.
